## Introduction

Email spam is a common issue, and this project aims to classify emails into spam or not spam using machine learning. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and then apply various machine learning models to achieve accurate classification.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare email text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transform text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Modeling**: Apply multiple machine learning algorithms to classify emails.
- **Evaluation**: Calculate accuracy and precision scores to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Plot Decision Trees and generate WordClouds.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
cd email-spam-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: Place your email dataset in the `data` folder.
2. **Run the Preprocessing Script**: Execute the script to clean and preprocess the email text.
3. **Train Models**: Run the script to train various machine learning models.
4. **Evaluate Models**: Evaluate the models and compare accuracy and precision scores.
5. **Visualize Results**: Generate visualizations like Decision Tree plots and WordClouds.

## Text Preprocessing

The text preprocessing pipeline includes:

- **Removing Punctuation**: Strip out unnecessary punctuation marks.
- **Removing Stopwords**: Remove common stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
- **Lowercase Conversion**: Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words (tokens).
- **Stemming**: Reduce words to their base or root form.
- **WordCloud Generation**: Visualize the most common words in the dataset.

## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms were applied to classify the emails:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **Decision Tree**

We used TF-IDF vectorization to transform the text data into numerical features that these algorithms can process.

## Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and precision scores. The focus was on improving precision to reduce the number of false positives in spam detection.

## Visualization

- **Decision Tree Plot**: Visualize the structure of the Decision Tree model to understand its decision-making process.
- **WordCloud**: Generate WordClouds to see the most frequent words in spam and non-spam emails.
